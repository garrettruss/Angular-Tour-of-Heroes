<!-- A routerLink attribute is set to "/heroes", the string that the router matches to the route to HeroesComponent. The routerLink is the selector for the RouterLink directive that turns user clicks into router navigations. It's another of the public directives in the RouterModule.-->
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
  <a routerLink="/heroes">Heroes</a>
</nav>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<!-- The AppComponent template no longer needs <app-heroes> because the application will only display the HeroesComponent when the user navigates to it.
The <router-outlet> tells the router where to display routed views.
The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule. The ng generate command you ran at the start of this tutorial added this import because of the --module=app flag. If you manually created app-routing.module.ts or used a tool other than the CLI to do so, you'll need to import AppRoutingModule into app.module.ts and add it to the imports array of the NgModule.-->

Summary
Pt1.
You created the initial application structure using the Angular CLI.
You learned that Angular components display data.
You used the double curly braces of interpolation to display the application title.

Pt2. 
You used the CLI to create a second HeroesComponent.
You displayed the HeroesComponent by adding it to the AppComponent shell.
You applied the UppercasePipe to format the name.
You used two-way data binding with the ngModel directive.
You learned about the AppModule.
You imported the FormsModule in the AppModule so that Angular would recognize and apply the ngModel directive.
You learned the importance of declaring components in the AppModule and appreciated that the CLI declared it for you.

Pt3. 
The Tour of Heroes application displays a list of heroes with a detail view.
The user can select a hero and see that hero's details.
You used *ngFor to display a list.
You used *ngIf to conditionally include or exclude a block of HTML.
You can toggle a CSS style class with a class binding.

Pt4. 
You created a separate, reusable HeroDetailComponent.
You used a property binding to give the parent HeroesComponent control over the child HeroDetailComponent.
You used the @Input decorator to make the hero property available for binding by the external HeroesComponent.

Pt5. 
You refactored data access to the HeroService class.
You registered the HeroService as the provider of its service at the root level so that it can be injected anywhere in the application.
You used Angular Dependency Injection to inject it into a component.
You gave the HeroService get data method an asynchronous signature.
You discovered Observable and the RxJS Observable library.
You used RxJS of() to return an observable of mock heroes (Observable<Hero[]>).
The component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook calls the HeroService method, not the constructor.
You created a MessageService for loosely-coupled communication between classes.
The HeroService injected into a component is created with another injected service, MessageService.

pt6. 
You added the Angular router to navigate among different components.
You turned the AppComponent into a navigation shell with <a> links and a <router-outlet>.
You configured the router in an AppRoutingModule
You defined routes, a redirect route, and a parameterized route.
You used the routerLink directive in anchor elements.
You refactored a tightly-coupled master/detail view into a routed detail view.
You used router link parameters to navigate to the detail view of a user-selected hero.
You shared the HeroService among multiple components.

pt7.
You added the necessary dependencies to use HTTP in the app.
You refactored HeroService to load heroes from a web API.
You extended HeroService to support post(), put(), and delete() methods.
You updated the components to allow adding, editing, and deleting of heroes.
You configured an in-memory web API.
You learned how to use observables.
