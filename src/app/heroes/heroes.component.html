<h2>My Heroes</h2>

<ul class="heroes">
<!-- To have access to each individual hero and list them all, add an *ngFor to the <li> to iterate through the list of heroes. The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list. The syntax in this example is as follows:

<li> is the host element.
heroes holds the mock heroes list from the HeroesComponent class, the mock heroes list.
hero holds the current hero object for each iteration through the list.Strip the <li> back to just its *ngFor, wrap the badge and name in an anchor element (<a>), and add a routerLink attribute to the anchor that is the same as in the dashboard template -->
   <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
    <a routerLink="/detail/{{hero.id}}">
      <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Dead Code - Refactored -- The HeroDetailComponent selector is 'app-hero-detail'. Add an <app-hero-detail> element near the bottom of the HeroesComponent template, where the hero detail view used to be Bind the HeroesComponent.selectedHero to the element's hero property like this. [hero]="selectedHero" is an Angular one way data property binding from the selectedHero property of the HeroesComponent to the hero property of the target element, which maps to the hero property of the HeroDetailComponent. Now when the user clicks a hero in the list, the selectedHero changes. When the selectedHero changes, the property binding updates hero and the HeroDetailComponent displays the new hero.-->

<!-- <app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail> -->
